I am Shashank Srivastava - a DevOps Architect with more than 11 years of experience in IT. I have good knowledge of Debian & RedHat based OS, MySQL & PostgreSQL databases, Cloud services (AWS) & Deployment/Release automation tools like XL Deploy/XL Release. I have also worked on a wide range of DevOps tools such as Jenkins, TravisCI, Nexus, Maven, SonarQube, Selenium, Ansible, Docker & Kubernetes.

I love to write code in my free time & I try to automate as much as possible. I enjoy writing Bash shell scripts for fun & to automate a few boring tasks.
