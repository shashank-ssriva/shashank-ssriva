👋 Hi, I’m Shashank Srivastava — a DevSecOps/Kubernetes Architect & Engineering Lead with over 15 years of experience building, securing, and automating scalable infrastructure.
🔧 I specialize in DevSecOps practices, cloud-native tooling, and CI/CD automation. My technical background spans across:
	•	🚀 Operating Systems: Deep hands-on expertise with both Debian and Red Hat-based Linux distributions.
	•	☁️ Cloud Platforms: Experience with AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.
	•	📊 Databases: Proficient with MySQL and PostgreSQL administration and optimization.
	•	⚙️ Deployment & Release Automation: Skilled in tools like XL Deploy/XL Release (now Digital.ai Deploy/Release).
	•	🛠️ DevOps Toolkit: Regularly work with Jenkins, TravisCI, Nexus, Artifactory, Maven, SonarQube, Checkmarx, Selenium, Ansible, Docker, and of course — Kubernetes & Python. Being tool agnostic is the key!
	•	🔒 Security & Monitoring: Experience with tools like Aqua Trivy, SonarQube, Sysdig Secure and other security integrations within the CI/CD pipeline.
💻 When I’m not working, I’m usually writing shell scripts to automate everyday tasks — I see automation as both a passion and a way of life. I enjoy coding for fun, especially in Python & Bash, and I’m always looking for creative ways to streamline processes.
